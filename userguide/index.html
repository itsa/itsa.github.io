<div class="paragraph">How to use ITSA modules</div>

<p>ITSA modules are CommonJS-modules which can be used in <code class="prettyprint">nodejs</code> or on the <code class="prettyprint">browser</code>. In both cases, you reference them with <code class="prettyprint">require(</code><span class="purple"><i>'modulename'</i></span><code class="prettyprint">)</code>.


<h1>With nodejs</h1>
<p>Your project will have these three elements:
    <ul>
        <li><span class="blue">scriptfile.js</span> (your codefile)</li>
        <li><span class="blue">package.json</span> (definition about the program and its dependencies)</li>
        <li><span class="blue">node_modules</span> (directory with all the packages)</li>
    </ul>
    You can create your own <code class="prettyprint">package.json</code>, or start with our <a href="./dist/package.json">distribution package.json</a>. It is important that every <b>require()</b> you use inside your scriptfile has its dependency defined inside package.json. Once you have set package.json up, you run <code class="prettyprint">npm install</code> which will create <b>node_modules</b> and all the required packages.
</p>

<p>
From there, you can start writing your scriptfile, which probably looks something like this:
<h2>Example scripfile.js</h2>
{% highlight js %}
var express = require('express'),
    ITSA = require('itsa'); // this is ITSA's rollup file
{% endhighlight %}
<code class="prettyprint">ITSA</code> is a namespace to 'itsa', which we created inside our package.json distribution. It has all ITSA's modules in the namespace. They are available like: <code class="prettyprint">ITSA.Event</code> and <code class="prettyprint">ITSA.IO</code>, see the <a href="{{ page.modules_url }}">moduledocumentation</a> how to use these modules.
<br>
<br>
If you are more familiair with creating <code class="prettyprint">package.json</code>-files, you might want to customize and choose only those modules you need. Read more about it at <a href="{{ page.customized_url }}">ITSA customized build</a>.
</p>


<h1>In the browser:</h1>
<p>Because the browser doesn't support "<code class="prettyprint">require()</code>", you need to bundled loader-file (bundled with <a href="http://browserify.org" target="_blank">Browerify</a>). Browserify inspects your code and creates a single bundle-file that holds all the requirements (and its dependencies) and will define the require()-method in the browser.</p>

<p>
The easiest way is to use our predefined <a href="./dist/itsabuild.tar">loaderfiles</a>. You can choose either to use the minified version <code class="prettyprint">itsabuild-min.js</code> (advisable) or the full-version <code class="prettyprint">itsabuild.js</code> for debugging.
</p>

<p>
The build-file should be included by a script tag <u>at the bottom of the document</u>, just above <code class="prettyprint">&lt;/body&gt;</code>. Followed by your code, which is within a <code class="prettyprint">&lt;script&gt;</code>-tag itself:
</p>
{% include loader-link.html %}
{% highlight js %}
<script>
    Event = ITSA.Event;
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

<code class="prettyprint">ITSA</code> is a namespace to 'itsa', which we created inside our package.json distribution. It has all ITSA's modules in the namespace. They are available like: <code class="prettyprint">ITSA.Event</code> and <code class="prettyprint">ITSA.IO</code>, see the <a href="{{ page.modules_url }}">moduledocumentation</a> how to use these modules.
<br>
<br>
Drawback of our build-files is, that they have <u>all of ITSA's modules</u> inside which might be more than you need. If you are more familiair with using <code class="prettyprint">ITSA</code>, you might want to customize the build-files yourself.
