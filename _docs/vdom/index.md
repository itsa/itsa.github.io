#The Basics#

The Virtual DOM gives you an API to manipulate the DOM. Manipulation happens through `document` and `Element`, but everything that happens afterward is handled by the `vnodes`. The whole DOM is virtualised into `vnodes`, where every domNode has a representative `vnode`.

Using the API, you have all native DOM features, but they work ultra-fast. Also, the API is extended with extreme useful methods, making work with the DOM fun again. This Virtual DOM is <u>not a fake-dom</u>, it is just an ultrafast proxylayer.

On the browser, there is no initialisation needed. Just load this module, use any `document` and `Element` method or properties as you were used to (or better, the new ones).

To speed up `DOM-rendering`, the principle of `diffing` is being used, like introduced by Reactjs. However, this Virtual DOM does not need a MVC-system to be operational, though the iView's benefit a lot of the Virtual DOM.



#Virtualising the DOM#

On startup, the complete DOM is virtualised into `vnodes`. These are plain objects with a reference to their domNode. Also the domNode gets a property vnode, which points to the related vnode. Manipulation of the DOM will be handled by these vnodes, which is tremendously faster than the native DOM. Traversing and searching through the vnodes goes ultrafast. Also, manipulating the DOM through vnodes goes by `diffing`.



#About Dom Nodes#

Technically spoken, the DOM consists of three different type of Nodes: Elements, TextNodes and CommentNodes (all virtualised into vnodes). However, you should work with the DOM by thinking of `Elements`. Whenever you query the DOM for a `Node`, you get an Element in return. These Elements are the objects the API returns and by which you can manipulate the DOM.



#Useful API#

The API is extended with very useful methods (and some properties). Read the full API-documentation for further details. Below is a summary of the API-methods you should use when working with the DOM.

<u>**NOTE:** `Do not use the next setters properties or methods`:</u>

* innerHTML setter
* outerHTML setter
* insertAdjacentElement
* insertAdjacentText
* insertAdjacentHTML

These <u>do work</u>, but they update their vnode's asynchronously. So, if you query the dom withing the same eventcycle, you are likely to get a wrong result. By using the adviced methods (explained below) you don't run into this situation. Moreover, these methods above don't update by using vdom's diffing. Which leads into slower update and problems with Node's disappearing and blurring.

CAUTIOUS:
You can use native propertysetter (like node.className), and they will update the vdom. But because this happens asynchr. (node.mutationobserver), the vdom isn't updated within its own eventcycle. Better use the added Element-methods which update the vdom right away
