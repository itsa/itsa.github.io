title: Simple Drag and Drop
intro: "Drag is a module which makes draggable items without any initialisation: <b>just plain HTML</b>. The code that takes care of this is loaded once and uses event-delegation to perform its task. You can set attributes on the HtmlElements and they will act as draggables. Of coarse these functionality can be given afterwards using javascript: you can set attributes yourself, or use Plugin's on the HtmlElements.<br><br>Because HTML defines the drag-behaviour, this module is <u>perfectly suited for serverside rendering</u>.<br><br>Dragging is done using the event-dom module which uses event delegation. Therefore it is very efficient, flexible and has no memoryleaks when dom-nodes are removed."
