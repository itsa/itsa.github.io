intro: "Enhancing Elements with node-plugins, which are basicly just extra attributes working together with modulecode."

#The Basics#

The `vdom`-module adds support for `node-plugins`, which can be plugged in into every Element. These plugins enchance the behaviour of the Element. DOM-nodes (only Elements) accept plugins by using the next 3 Element-methods:

* plug
* unplug
* hasPlugin

Whenever a `node-plugin` is active, it adds extra `attributes` to the Element, identifying the plugin is active - and optionally extra attributes for additional parameters. All node-plugin's work in a way that these attributes controll the state of the plugin. Thus, you could change the attributes instead of using the plugin-methods mentioned above. The plugin will just do its work, asuming its module is loaded.


##Using plugins##

A plugin can be set on a Node (only Element), by using `Element.plugin`:

####Example plugin without options####
```js
var myNode = document.getElement('#mynode');
myNode.plug(ITSA.Plugins.Constrain);
// will constrain repositioning to the window
```

This leads into a HTML like this:

```html
<div constrain-selector="window"></div>
```

####Example plugin with options####
```js
var myNode = document.getElement('#mynode');
myNode.plug(ITSA.Plugins.Constrain, {selector: '#container'});
// will constrain repositioning to the node with id=`container`
```

This leads into a HTML like this:

```html
<div constrain-selector="#container"></div>
```

Or in relation with the rest of the page:

```html
<div id="container">
    <div constrain-selector="#container"></div>
</div>
```


##Developing plugins##

A plugin is created by using the method `document.definePlugin`.

When using `definePlugin`, it requires at least one argument: the `namespace` of your Plugin. The namespace will be used to prepend attributes like this: `ns-`. This way, all attributes made by the plugin are well defined. The second argument is an optional constructor, the third an optional object, containing any default-values.

####Samplecode of the constrain plugin####
```js
ITSA.Plugins.Constrain = window.document.definePlugin('constrain', null, {
        attrs: {
            selector: 'string'
        },
        defaults: {
            selector: 'window'
        }
    }
);
```


##Available plugins##

The vdom comes with one Node-plugin:
